# Monochrome Reflections

## A photography project that should reflect some of the things I have learned on my way to become a (Full Stack) Developer.

This file was created on 2021-08-21, but I already have spent some time working on this project. From now on I (hopefully) will put more effort in this file to make some notes about what I have done so far.

## Things I used (so far):

- HTML
    - Included an svg file directly inside the HTML
- CSS
    - @keyframe animations
    - @media queries
- GitHub
    - With a main and a development branch
- Google Fonts (embedded locally)
